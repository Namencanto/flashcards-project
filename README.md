# **Future Features** :bulb:

---

### 1. Public Profiles Logic

In the future, we are planning to implement the public profile functionality, which will allow users to showcase their learning progress and achievements to others. It will include a user's statistics, ranking, last learned flashcards and more. This feature will make it easier for users to connect with others who have similar interests and learning goals.

### 2. Flashcards Search

We are also working on adding a flashcards searcher, which will enable users to search for specific flashcards or flashcard sets based on keywords, categories, and other parameters. This feature will make it easier for users to find the content they are looking for, and help them to quickly access it.

### 3. More Courses

Finally, we are planning to expand our course offerings to include a wider range of topics and subjects. This will make our platform more accessible and relevant to a broader range of users, and allow us to continue to provide high-quality educational resources to our users.

We are always looking for ways to improve our platform and make it more useful for our users, and these future features are just a few examples of what we have planned. If you have any ideas or suggestions for future features, please feel free to reach out to us and let us know!
